    How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
    
    Interpreting user needs would require good communication with the client in what the requirements are and why they are important. Having clear requirements allows me to implement a feature into a program that will pass any tests based on the requirements from the client. User stories helps put me in the user's shoes and allows me to visualize what the user will see, how the user will interact with the program, and why that feature is important to the user. 
    
    How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
    
    To approach developing a program, I would use certain agile processes in order to build the program quickly and effectively. One of those processes would be creating user stories, and organizing them by priority. This allows me to plan what will be worked on and when, as well as establishing what is important to the client/user. 
    
    What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
    
    A good team member in software development means that I would do my own work to the best of my ability as fast as possible, offer aid to those who are impeded by things that I can help with, and communicate effectively with my team members as to how my work is going and what is impeding me. Being available and open to feedback is also important as a team member in software development, because I believe that one can learn something from everyone.
